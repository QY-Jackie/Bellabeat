--Upload the chosen data file to BigQuery of Google Cloud.

--Clean data:

--1. Daily activity
--a) check for duplicate data

Select Id, ActivityDate, TotalSteps, Count(*)
From`sigma-cairn-402317.Wellness.dailyActivity`
Group by Id, ActivityDate, TotalSteps
Having Count(*)>1

--b) Add a column showing day of week based on the ActivityDate column, and add a new date column having the date format changed:

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `sigma-cairn-402317.Wellness.dailyActivity_new` 
AS
SELECT *, FORMAT_DATE('%A', ActivityDate) AS DayofWeek,FORMAT_DATE('%b-%d-%Y', ActivityDate) AS Date
FROM `sigma-cairn-402317.Wellness.dailyActivity1`

--2. Heart rate
--Split the data and time into two columns and change the format:

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `sigma-cairn-402317.Wellness.heart_rate_`   
AS    
SELECT Id,Time,Value,     
FORMAT_DATE('%b-%d-%Y',DATE(Time)) AS Date, FORMAT_TIME('%T',TIME(Time)) AS Time_  
FROM `sigma-cairn-402317.Wellness.heartrate`

--3. Similar method applied to the rest files to have to the split date and time columns and consistent format:
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `sigma-cairn-402317.Wellness.hourlyCalories_new`   
AS    
SELECT *,     
FORMAT_DATE('%b-%d-%Y',DATE(ActivityHour)) AS Date, FORMAT_TIME('%T',TIME(ActivityHour)) AS Time
FROM `sigma-cairn-402317.Wellness.hourlyCalories`
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `sigma-cairn-402317.Wellness.hourlyIntensities_new`   
AS    
SELECT *,     
FORMAT_DATE('%b-%d-%Y',DATE(ActivityHour)) AS Date, FORMAT_TIME('%T',TIME(ActivityHour)) AS Time
FROM `sigma-cairn-402317.Wellness.hourlyIntensities`

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `sigma-cairn-402317.Wellness.hourlySteps_new`   
AS    
SELECT *,     
FORMAT_DATE('%b-%d-%Y',DATE(ActivityHour)) AS Date, FORMAT_TIME('%T',TIME(ActivityHour)) AS Time
FROM `sigma-cairn-402317.Wellness.hourlySteps`

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `sigma-cairn-402317.Wellness.sleepDay_new`   
AS    
SELECT *,     
FORMAT_DATE('%b-%d-%Y',DATE(SleepDay)) AS Date, FORMAT_TIME('%T',TIME(SleepDay)) AS Time
FROM `sigma-cairn-402317.Wellness.sleepDay`

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `sigma-cairn-402317.Wellness.weightLogInfo_new`   
AS    
SELECT *,     
FORMAT_DATE('%b-%d-%Y',DATE(Date)) AS Date_, FORMAT_TIME('%T',TIME(Date)) AS Time
FROM `sigma-cairn-402317.Wellness.weightLogInfo`

--4. Delete the original files and keep the cleaned files.

--5. Summarize how many users based from whom each data set was collected:
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Id) AS Total_Users
FROM `sigma-cairn-402317.Wellness.dailyActivity_new`
UNION ALL
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Id) AS Total_Users
FROM `sigma-cairn-402317.Wellness.heart_rate_`
UNION ALL
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Id) AS Total_Users
FROM `sigma-cairn-402317.Wellness.hourlyCalories_new`
UNION ALL
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Id) AS Total_Users
FROM `sigma-cairn-402317.Wellness.hourlyIntensities_new`
UNION ALL
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Id) AS Total_Users
FROM `sigma-cairn-402317.Wellness.hourlySteps_new`
UNION ALL
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Id) AS Total_Users
FROM `sigma-cairn-402317.Wellness.sleepDay_new`
UNION ALL
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Id) AS Total_Users
FROM `sigma-cairn-402317.Wellness.weightLogInfo_new`
